Using the data from my city's school district, I manipulated the data to find trends in terms of student performance. I created multiple tables for each school, each grade, school type, school spending, and school size.I also noticed that schools with the least spending per student had better passing and average overall scores. Furthermore, the overall math and reading scores decreased as the spending for each student increased.Another observation I made was that larger schools, schools with 2000 to 5000 students, had significantly lower overall scores compared to schools with less than 2000 students.
